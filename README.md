# Assgn3
This is the repo for the third assignment of the Machine Learning course, ELL409 at IIT Delhi. The assignment consists of two parts:
<br>
<h3>1) Polynomial Curve Fitting</h3>
Given data consisting of 100 data points construct a curve equation that fits the data.
<br>
<h3>2) An SVM based classifier/identifier for ncRNA's </h3>
ncRNA's are the non-coding RNA's in the cell. Given the feature vector consisting of data from the RNA constructed using the Dynalign algorithm.
The SVM will be using two kernels: Linear and Gaussian(RBF)
